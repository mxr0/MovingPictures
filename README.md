# Moving Pictures

Re-write of an old, not very succesful, RTS called "Outpost 2". Started when I found a [fansite](http://www.outpostuniverse.net/) that had extracted all of the art and sounds.

Graphics performance is very poor as it runs using Java2D and uses all software rendering.

Requires Java 1.6
It should be enough to be download the repo and run moving-pictures/MovingPictures5/run/launcher.[bat|sh]
